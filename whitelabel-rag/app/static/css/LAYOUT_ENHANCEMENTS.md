## File Structure

- `bootstrap-style-guide.css` - Main style guide CSS file
- `style-guide-navigation.css` - Navigation component styles
- `style-guide-navigation.js` - JavaScript for navigation interactivity
- `BOOTSTRAP_STYLE_GUIDE.md` - Documentation for the style guide
- `style-guide-updated.html` - Example page demonstrating all components

## Azure Design Principles Applied

1. **Clean, Flat UI**
   - Subtle shadows instead of heavy borders
   - Flat colors with minimal gradients
   - Focused states that are clear but not distracting

2. **Consistent Spacing System**
   - Standardized margins and padding
   - Consistent component spacing
   - Proper whitespace for readability

3. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**
   - Defined heading styles and sizes
   - Consistent card and panel structures
   - Clear separation between sections

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Adaptive layouts that work on all screen sizes
   - Proper stacking on smaller screens

## Usage Instructions

1. Include the style files in your HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/bootstrap-style-guide.css">
```

2. For Azure-style components, use the `azure-` prefixed classes:
```html
<div class="azure-card">
  <div class="azure-card-header">
    <h5 class="azure-card-title">Card Title</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="azure-card-body">
    Card content here
  </div>
</div>
```

3. For responsive layouts, use the grid system:
```html
<div class="standard-row">
  <div class="standard-col-12 standard-col-md-6 standard-col-lg-4">
    Content here
  </div>
</div>
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply the new components to the main application interface
2. Refine dark mode support for all Azure components
3. Create component-specific JavaScript behaviors
4. Implement additional Azure Portal components like tabs and wizards
